# IoT_Assignment_2_Obstacle-Detection


Assignment Description
Visually impaired people use blind cane to scan their paths and finding the safe orientation. With our knowledge so far, we are going to enhance the blind with sensors and actuator to alert the visually impaired people and others around there. The scenario is simple;
1. The head of the blind cane shall have obstacle detection sensor (ultrasonic sensor), this will continuously detect any obstacle ahead (every less than a second). The distance from the obstacle shall be measured in cm.
2. When the distance from the obstacle drops below 60cm, the buzzer on the blind cane shall sound and the red LED shall keep blinking (all after every 1 second).
